   <p>I worked in government since 1997 both on a volunteer basis and in a paid status. I have worked with many different government agencies to gain broad knowledge.
    I have been a small business owner for the last 4 years in real estate investing, hotel owner, and other family businesses </p>

        I currently serve on the Tourism Deveopment Authority for New Hanover County and all of the beaches. I have learned how to work with many different avenues to include applications and webpages and how to navigate to all of the different city websites as links.

        <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and being outdoors as much as possible since I live at the beach! We enjoy things such as gaming, golfing, biking, hiking, camping, having meals together, and watching what amazing adults they are becoming every day. My wife is the single individual that talked me into becoming a computer programmer in order to create innovative, cutting edge prodcut deveopment to better assist government agencies while making sure it isn't abused and at the same time keeps the government agencies from overreaching and opressing any group of people.</p>
