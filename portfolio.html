<h3>I have had the opportunity to work on several different projects thoughout my experience with coding. Below is a small list of the projects I have had the opportunity to work with.</h3>

<h4>My very first project was developing a page for the local zoo to provide interns with the ability to know about the different animals they would be working with and how to identify them as well as know some basic information about the different animals. 

    <h4>Another project I had the opportunity to work on was developing an itemized list of different grocery items a customer would be purchasing at the supermarket. I was able to use different blocks to show what item belonged where and the general area they could be located in the store. I also used basic css styling to make the page look better to the eye.

<h4>The current project I am working on is building this site to introduce myself and let you know some of the basic things I enjoy doing in life as well as provide the opportunity to speak about the projects I have had the opportunity to work on in this short period of time.
